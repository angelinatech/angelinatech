### Oh hi! ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Angel, a software engineer from the U.K. I mainly focus on the PERN stack and front-end frameworks. I'm a big fan of creating opportunities in tech for people as yet underrepresented in our industry and I believe strongly in open source and the importance of ethical technology.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d love to collaborate on projects with an emphasis on accessibility and education, or generally good things for the world :blush:
